NFL teams are divided into offense, defense, and special teams, with each position serving a unique function. The quarterback (QB) leads the offense — Tom Brady, the all-time leader in passing yards and touchdowns, is widely considered the greatest QB in history. Running backs (RBs) carry the ball and catch passes; Emmitt Smith holds the record for most career rushing yards. Wide receivers (WRs) specialize in catching passes — Jerry Rice dominates the record books with the most receiving yards and touchdowns. On the offensive line (OL), players like centers and tackles protect the QB and create running lanes. On defense, players include linebackers (LBs) like Ray Lewis, known for tackles and leadership, and defensive backs such as cornerbacks (CBs) and safeties (S) who defend against the pass. Defensive linemen (DL) rush the passer and stop the run — Bruce Smith leads all-time in sacks. Special teams feature kickers and punters; Adam Vinatieri holds the record for most points scored. Every position requires specialized skills, and elite players at each have helped define eras of NFL history through their individual contributions and records.
