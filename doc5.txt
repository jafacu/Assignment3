NFL games are played in four 15-minute quarters, with a halftime after the second quarter. Teams score points in various ways: a touchdown earns 6 points, with an option for a 1-point kick or 2-point conversion. Field goals are worth 3 points, and a safety gives 2 points to the defense. Overtime rules differ between regular season and playoffs, with each team guaranteed a possession in postseason OT unless the first drive ends in a touchdown. The longest field goal in NFL history was a 66-yarder by Justin Tucker in 2021. High-scoring games also make headlines — the 1966 game between Washington and the New York Giants totaled 113 points, still an NFL record. The game is played with 11 players per side, and penalties can drastically affect outcomes — common infractions include holding, offsides, and pass interference. Replay reviews and challenges are used to ensure fairness. In recent years, rules have evolved to protect quarterbacks and minimize head injuries. Understanding the scoring system and basic rules is essential for enjoying NFL games and analyzing the strategies behind each team’s play.
