The NFL season kicks off in early September and ends in February with the Super Bowl. Each team plays 17 regular-season games across 18 weeks. After the regular season, 14 teams (7 from each conference) enter the playoffs, culminating in the AFC and NFC Championship Games. Winners of these face off in the Super Bowl — the biggest event in American sports. The Super Bowl MVP award has been won multiple times by legends like Tom Brady, who also holds the record for most Super Bowl victories (7). Beyond the U.S., the NFL has expanded its presence internationally. The NFL International Series includes games in London, Munich, and previously Mexico City. In 2024, five international games were played, highlighting the league’s global appeal. The Jacksonville Jaguars have become a frequent team abroad, even playing back-to-back games in London. The Pro Bowl, an all-star game, is now part of “Pro Bowl Games,” held the week before the Super Bowl. NFL games are broadcast in over 180 countries, with an estimated global fanbase exceeding 300 million. The season’s mix of tradition, spectacle, and expansion continues to fuel the NFL’s popularity worldwide.
