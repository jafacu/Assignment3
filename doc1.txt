The National Football League (NFL) was founded in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association and adopted its current name in 1922. Today, the NFL consists of 32 teams divided equally between the American Football Conference (AFC) and the National Football Conference (NFC). Each conference has four divisions: North, South, East, and West. A key historical milestone was the 1970 AFL-NFL merger, which helped solidify the NFL’s dominance in American sports. The league’s championship game, the Super Bowl, is now one of the most-watched sporting events globally. The Green Bay Packers hold the record for the most total championships (13), while the New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers share the most Super Bowl wins with six each. The Arizona Cardinals, originally founded as the Morgan Athletic Club in 1898, are the oldest professional football team still active. The NFL operates under a salary cap and revenue-sharing model to maintain competitive balance. Headquarters are in New York City, and the league is governed by a Commissioner — currently Roger Goodell. The NFL’s season structure and rules have evolved, but its popularity has steadily grown into a multi-billion dollar global enterprise.
